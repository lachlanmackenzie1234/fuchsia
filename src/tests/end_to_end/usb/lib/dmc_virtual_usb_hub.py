    """Virtually unplugs and plugs in the device through DMC in Fuchsia infra.

    The infra counterpart of `LinuxVirtualUsbAuthorizePowerHub`. Instead of
    writing the host sysfs `authorized` attribute itself, it runs
    `dmc set-usb-authorized`, which makes the device management server (DMS)
    on the host the device is attached to look up the device's USB bus ID and
    toggle its `authorized` attribute. DMS also authorizes the device again in
    its task cleanup, health check and recovery, so a test that dies while the
    device is unplugged does not leave it disconnected.

    Only works for devices hosted in Fuchsia infra labs, where the `DMC_PATH`
    environment variable is set.

        device_name: Device name returned by `ffx target list`, which is also
            the device nodename known to DMS.
